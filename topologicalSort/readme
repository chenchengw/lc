topological sort algorithm using an queue.
1. Store each vertexâ€™s In-Degree in an array and build the graph if not yet
2. Initialize a queue with all in-degree zero vertices
3. While there are vertices remaining in the queue:
    Dequeue and output a vertex
    Reduce In-Degree of all vertices adjacent to it by 1
    Enqueue any of these vertices whose In-Degree became zero

time complexity: O(|V| + |E|)
